heads_need_bodies
=================

A Reddit bot that matches bodies to heads/faces posted as comments.

This code is really rough but since it's my first real attempt at anything like this, I'm not too ashamed.

It uses Python/PRAW and should be pretty self-explanatory. Feel free to chip in with code advice, or just more bodies to add to the library.
